List of Implemented features:
1. Display Weather data of a place using OpenWeather API. 
2. Search feature to get the weather data of any city.
3. Locator button on top right to get the weather details of users location, fetched using api-ipify API (for getting ip address) and ip-api API(to get user location using IP). 


Bugs/Errors
 1. Keeps loading without any result if you enter wrong city name/spelling errors.
 2. User location might be slightly inaccurate sometimes as the API uses IP address to fetch current location.
