     1. Display Weather data of a place using  
        OpenWeather API.

         any city. 
     3. Locator button on top right to get the 
         weather details of users location, fetched 
         using api-ipify API (for getting ip address)  
         and ip-api API(to get user location using IP)
b. Bugs/Errors
     1. Keeps loading without any result if you 
         enter wrong city name/spelling errors.

         sometimes as the API uses IP address to 
         fetch current location.
